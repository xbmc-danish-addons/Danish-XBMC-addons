This was the old git repository for a number of the danish XBMC addons.

They have now been extracted to seperate repositories at:
* https://github.com/xbmc-danish-addons/
* https://github.com/twinther/

Usually all addons can be installed directly from XBMC.

If you have comments or suggestions for these addons, please feel free
to participate in the debate on my blog at http://tommy.winther.nu

If you are looking for xbmcstubs, I have instead forked Tenzer's repo:
https://github.com/twinther/xbmcstubs
